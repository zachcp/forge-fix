# This directory contains feedstock submodules
# Each feedstock should be:
# 1. Forked to your GitHub account
# 2. Added as a submodule: git submodule add https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/package-feedstock packages/package-feedstock
# 3. Worked on in a recipe-v1 branch
# 4. Pushed to your fork
# 5. PR'd to upstream conda-forge

# Don't ignore anything - we want to track submodules
# (This file exists mainly for documentation purposes)
